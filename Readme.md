## 🔍 Key Insights & Features  
- **Fuel-Type Analysis**  
  - Comparison of vehicles using **Diesel vs Gasoline**.  
  - Distribution of fuel types across different car brands.  

- **Engine & Cylinders Analysis**  
  - Breakdown of cars by **number of cylinders** across manufacturers.  
  - Visualization of performance and engine variety in the dataset.  

- **Body-Style Analysis**  
  - Count of car makes across **sedan, hatchback, wagon, convertible, and hardtop** categories.  

- **Price vs Fuel-Type**  
  - Relationship between vehicle **prices** and fuel types.  

- **Make & Manufacturer Analysis**  
  - Distribution of cars by **brand** (Mazda, Honda, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, etc.).  
  - Highlighting manufacturers with the highest variety of models.
